# ðŸ§ª Clinical Trial Database Simulation

This project simulates a clinical trial database using PostgreSQL. It includes a realistic data model, mock data for patients, visits, test results, medications, adverse events, and operational structures like sites and protocols. It's designed to demonstrate my SQL and database development skills for an **Associate Database Developer** position.

## ðŸ§  Description

The database replicates essential components of a clinical trial Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, simulating:

- Patient demographics and enrollment
- Clinical visits and lab test results
- Medication records and adverse events
- Protocol management
- Site and investigator assignment

Data was generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com) to reflect realistic clinical scenarios.

## ðŸ§­ Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between all tables in the clinical trial database:

## ðŸ—‚ Schema Overview

| Table                    | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `patients`               | Demographic and enrollment data for each patient              |
| `visits`                 | Patient visit records with visit type and notes               |
| `labs`                   | Lab test results tied to patients                             |
| `medications`            | Medications prescribed or administered to patients            |
| `adverse_events`         | Adverse events reported during the clinical trial             |
| `sites`                  | Clinical trial sites and their locations                      |
| `investigators`          | Trial investigators and their roles/contact info              |
| `protocols`              | Protocols defining the structure and scope of clinical trails |
| `site_investigators`     | Many-to-many mapping of investigators to trial sites          |
| `protocol_sites`         | Many-to-many mapping to protocols to sites                    |
| `protocol_investigators` | Many-to-many mapping of protocols to investigators            |

## ðŸ§  Example SQL Queries

```sql
-- List all patients along with their most recent visit date
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, MAX(v.visit_date) AS last_visit
FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN visits v ON p.patient_id = v.patient_id
GROUP BY p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name;
    
-- Patients who experienced more than 2 adverse events
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, COUNT(*) AS adverse_event_count
FROM patients p
JOIN adverse_events ae ON p.patient_id = ae.patient_id
GROUP BY p.patient_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- Average test result per test_name
SELECT test_name, ROUND(AVG(test_result), 2) AS average_result
FROM labs
GROUP BY test_name;

-- All investigators working at a specific site (e.g., site_id = 1)
SELECT s.name AS site_name, i.first_name, i.last_name, i.role
FROM site_investigators si
JOIN sites s ON si.site_id = s.site_id
JOIN investigators i ON si.investigator_id = i.investigator_id
WHERE si.site_id = 1;

```

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Add stored procedures for common operations
- Include views for reporting
- Add user roles and permissions
- Include testing using Python test scripts
